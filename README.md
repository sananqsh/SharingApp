# SharingApp
An android app to share items with contacts!

This project was my capstone assignment for [Object-Oriented Design course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design?specialization=software-design-architecture) in Coursera by the amazing Alberta University instructors.

Everything after the initial commit is what I've contributed to the project; which is adding `Contact` and `ContactList` 
and their respective layouts and activities.
